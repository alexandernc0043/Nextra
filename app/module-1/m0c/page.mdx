## Steps

<Steps>

### Create your accounts

Create accounts on [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) (ideally using the google account tied to your school account). Your username must either include your name, initials, mascot or something else that easily identifies it as you (since we have to cross-reference with your name in Canvas). Feel free to add any additional information to your profiles there. 

### Adjust Privacy settings

Adjust the profile settings to allow us to see your information - specifically points, timelines, etc... anything that would demonstrate you've done the things that you'll need to be doing. You can test that we can see these things by opening the URL you're going to submit here in a private/incognito window - if it works thru the private window, then we'll be able to see it. If it doesn't, we won't. 

### Complete 10 Steps on freeCodeCamp

I would suggest starting on [freeCodeCamp #1](./fcc-one) and completing 10 steps.


### Complete Welcome to Codecademy lesson

On Codecademy search for `Welcome to Codecademy` and complete the lesson.
