    ### Install GitHub Desktop
    You can download GitHub Desktop from [here](https://desktop.github.com/download/).\
    <Callout>You do not need to use GitHub Desktop and may use another Git Client or use the Git CLI. We recommend it as

</Steps>
## Set up GitHub
<Steps>
    ### Go to [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com) and sign in or sign up for an account.

    ### Navigate to the create repository button and create a repository.

    ### Name the repository as follows: **YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME**.github.io
    <Callout type={"info"}>
        My GitHub username is **alexandernc0043** so my repository should be named
        alexandernc0043.github.io
    </Callout>
    <Callout type={"error"}>
        If you do not name your repository exactly like that your webpage will not
        work.
    </Callout>
    ### Open GitHub Desktop and clone your repository.

    ### Open your cloned repository in Visual Studio Code by clicking the button inside GitHub Desktop.
</Steps>

## Creating your first webpage.
<Steps>
    ### Create index.html
    Inside your folder create a file named `index.html`

    ### Generate the boilerplate code
    Using Visual Studio Code's [Emmett](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/) tool type an ! and hit Tab or Enter on your
    keyboard.
    Your file should look like this now:
    ```html
    <!-- USERNAME.github.io/index.html -->
    <
    !DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8"/>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/>
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body></body>
    </html>
    ```
    ### Edit your title
    You can edit the title by editing the word Document inside this element `<title>Document</title>` with \[YOUR_NAME\]
    \[Divider\] Homepage

    **Example(s):**
    ```html
    <title>Alexander Prechtel | Homepage</title>
    <title>Alexander Prechtel ~ Homepage</title>
    <title>Alexander Prechtel - Homepage</title>
    ```
    ### Add a heading
    Inside your body element add a Heading 1 element `<h1>` and put the following:
    ```html
    <h1>Welcome to my homepage!</h1>
    ```
    ### Add a link to your course page
    Add an anchor element `<a>` after your heading 1 element that will take you to your course page.
    ```html
    <a href="itis3135">Click here to go to my ITIS-3135 course page!</a>
    ```
    <Callout>The `href` attribute stands for hypertext refrence and the value of it is where your link will go.</Callout>

    **Your body should now look like this:**
    ```html
    <!-- USERNAME.github.io/index.html -->
    <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my homepage!</h1>
    <a href="itis3135">Click here to go to my ITIS-3135 coursepage!</a>
    </body>
    ```
</Steps>

## Creating your course page
<Steps>
   ### Create your course folder
   Inside your GITHUB_USER_NAME.github.io folder create a folder named `itis3135`
   <Callout type={"info"}>
       In the future your GITHUB_USER_NAME.github.io folder will be referred to as
       the "root" of your website
   </Callout>
   ### Create your second `index.html` file
   Inside your `itis3135` folder create a new file called `index.html`
   ### Open your new `index.html`
   Inside your new `index.html` file copy the contents from your previous `index.html` file.
   ### Remove the link `<a>`
   Since you are already on your course page you don't need a link to your course page.
   ### Replace homepage
   Everywhere you see homepage you should replace with `ITIS-3135 course page`

   Your new `index.html` file should look like this now:
   ```html
   <!-- USERNAME.github.io/itis3135/index.html -->
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8"/>
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/>
       <title>Alexander Prechtel | ITIS-3135 Course page</title>
   </head>
   <body>
   <h1>Welcome to my ITIS-3135 course page!</h1>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
   ### Create more folders
   Inside your itis3135 folder create 6 new folders with the names:
   1. images
   2. components
   3. scripts
   4. styles
   5. project
   6. archives
   <Callout type={"info"}>
       GitHub won't track folders with no files inside. You can add a README.md file
       if you want to have it be tracked but that's not required.
   </Callout>
</Steps>
## Creating your UNCC webspace
<Steps>
    ### Request your UNCC webpage
    Request your UNCC Webspace by visiting [webpages.charlotte.edu](https://webpages.charlotte.edu/) and signing in with
    your NinerNet account and clicking request account.
    <Callout type={"info"}>This can take up to 10 minutes to provision.</Callout>

    Once your webpage is created you can visit webpages.charlotte.edu/**YOUR_NINER_NET_USERNAME**/ and you should see a template website saying it's been created.
    <Callout type={"default"}>
        **Example:**
        [https://webpages.charlotte.edu/aprechte](https://webpages.charlotte.edu/aprechte)
    </Callout>
    ### Use FileZilla to transfer your files to your university webspace.
    <Callout type={"info"}>
        If you are off campus you will need to use the Cisco Secure VPN you
        installed in previous steps. Inside the box when opening Cisco Secure
        Client you will type **vpn.charlotte.edu** then Login with your NinerNet
        account details.
    </Callout>
    ### Conecting to the university's FTP server.
    > Details for connecting to the FTP Server\
    **Host:** webpages.charlotte.edu\
    **Username:** YOUR_NINER_NET_USERNAME DO NOT INCLUDE @charlotte.edu\
    **Password:** YOUR_NINER_NET_PASSWORD\
    **Port:** 22\
    Once you are connected you should see your computer's files on the left and the server's on the right
    ### On the server side open the `public_html` folder.
    `public_html` is where you should be placing all work.
    ### Find your GITHUB_USER_NAME.github.io folder on your computer.
    Your computer's files are the ones on the left side. Also the default location for GitHub repositorys is Documents/GitHub.
    ### Archive your default index.html
    Once you have located your folder drag the `publc_html/index.html` folder on the server side inside your `GITHUB_USER.github.io/itis3135/archive` folder
    ### Now move your project files
    After you have archived the default `index.html` file done that move your `index.html` in the `root` of your website and `itis3135` folder into the `public_html` folder on the server side.
    
    Your file tree should look like this now:
    <FileTree>
      <FileTree.Folder name="public_html" defaultOpen>
          <FileTree.Folder name="itis3135">
            <FileTree.File name="index.html" defaultOpen/>
            <FileTree.Folder name="images"/>
            <FileTree.Folder name="styles"/>
            <FileTree.Folder name="components"/>
            <FileTree.Folder name="scripts"/>
            <FileTree.Folder name="projects"/>
            <FileTree.Folder name="archives" defaultOpen>
                <FileTree.File name="index.html" />
            </FileTree.Folder>
          </FileTree.Folder>
          <FileTree.File name="index.html" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree>
    <Callout>This file tree is interactive :)</Callout>
