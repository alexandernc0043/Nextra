# Create Your Mascot Business

## Choose Your Mascot

Your **business name is your mascot** — the animal you introduced yourself with and that appears on your websites.  

- Make sure you’re happy with it. If not, **change it in all locations NOW**.  
- Rule of thumb:  
  - The **adjective** should start with the same letter as your **first name**.  
  - The **creature** should start with the same letter as your **last name**.  
- If your name has multiple words, pick one or get creative.  

**Examples:**  
- *D.I. von Briesen* → **Dapper Indignant Viper** → *Dapper Viper* → *Diligent Indignant Voracious Baboon*

## Pick a Whimsical Business Idea

Once you’re set on your mascot, invent a **unique whimsical business idea**.  

Rules:  
- **It must be unique to you.** Avoid duplicating a classmate’s idea.  
- Skip obvious ideas like “fried chicken” or “phone cases.” Those are too generic.  
- Aim for something small and specific, like a mall kiosk, food truck, or quirky product shop.  

For inspiration:  
- Watch [Dave Eggers’ TED Talk on 826 Valencia](https://www.ted.com/talks/dave_eggers_once_upon_a_school) → examples start around 16 minutes.  
- Think *Forrest Gump shrimp* scene: one idea, **many playful variations**.

## Add Your Idea to the Sites List

- Go to the **Sites List** in this module on Canvas.  
- Add your mascot + whimsical business idea to prevent duplicates.

## Build Your Whimsical Business Website

1. Create a new website with at least:
   - `index.html`
   - `about.html`
2. Each page must include:
   - `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`  
   - **Consistent headers/footers** across all pages  
   - Folder structure similar to your course site (images, scripts, etc.)
3. This site should have a **different style** than your course site.  
4. Add it to your **common navigation** (so all your sites are connected).

## Content Requirements

- After your `h2` page title in `<main>`, include:
  - **1–2 paragraphs** about your whimsical business (what it does/sells).  
- Create a **slogan or tagline**:
  - Place it in the header *or* footer.  
  - Format it in *italics* **or** “quotes” (but not both).  
  - **Rule of thumb:**  
    - If you imagine people saying it out loud → use “quotes”  
    - If it’s more descriptive → use *italics*  
- Use semantic emphasis (`<strong>` / `<em>`) instead of `<b>` / `<i>`.  
- You can stretch the theme creatively:  
  - Example: *“Salty Dog”* could run a shop for **crochet fingerless gloves**.  
  - Either adjust your mascot to match your idea, or lean into the fun mismatch.  

**Key Point:** From now on, **all your pages must reflect this theme** — it should be obvious to anyone who visits your site.

   - “I have filled out the Sites List page”
