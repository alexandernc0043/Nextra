# Integrating Common Headers and Footers

## Overview

One of the key principles of professional web development is **consistency**. Instead of manually copying the same `<header>` and `<footer>` across every page, you should use a method to **reuse and maintain** common code easily.  

For this course, we’ll use [Paul Browne’s HTMLInclude](https://github.com/Paul-Browne/HTMLInclude/) — a lightweight script that lets you include common HTML fragments like headers, footers, or nav bars into multiple pages.

### Why This Matters

- **Consistency** → every page has the same header/footer  
- **Efficiency** → update once, apply everywhere  
- **Professionalism** → closer to how templating systems (like React, Next.js, or server-side includes) work in the real world

### Setting Up HTMLInclude

1. **Download or reference the script**  
   - Get the script from [GitHub](https://github.com/Paul-Browne/HTMLInclude/)  
   - Place it in your project folder (e.g., `scripts/include.min.js`)
