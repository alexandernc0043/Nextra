# Personal Homepage Submisison

## Overview

Modify your personal home page `index.html` that serves as your main landing page for both your school website and GitHub Pages. This page should be professional, represent you well, and serve as a gateway to your coursework and professional profiles. You should go through the first HTML tutorials before doing this.

### Requirements

#### HTML Semantic Elements

In addition to the boilerplate HTML code all pages should use in addition:

##### Header (`<header></header>{:html}`)

- `<h1></h1>{:html}`

> [!NOTE]
>
> Your H1 should be the name of your website.

##### Main (`<main></main>{:html}`)

- `<h2></h2>{:html}`

> [!NOTE]
>
> Your H2 should be the name of your page

##### Footer (`<footer></footer>{:html}`)

Your footer should contain navigation links with a divider seperating each link

**Example:** [GitHub](https://www.github.com/alexandernc0043) ~ [GitHub.io](https://alexandernc0043.github.io) ~ [ITIS 3135](https://alexandernc0043.github.io/itis3135) ~ [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-prechtel-b4a0a9283/)

- Links:
    - GitHub
    > This should link to your GitHub Profile\
    > **Example:** [github.com/alexandernc0043](https://www.github.com/alexandernc0043)

    - GitHub.io
    > This should link to your GitHub Pages\
    > **Example:** [alexandernc0043.github.io](https://alexandernc0043.github.io)

    - LinkedIn
    > This should link to your LinkedIn Profile\
    > **Example:** [https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-prechtel-b4a0a9283/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-prechtel-b4a0a9283/)

    - ITIS 3135
    > This should link to your ITIS 3135 Page\
    > **Example:** [./itis3135/](https://alexandernc0043.github.io/itis3135)

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >
    > This link should be **relative** not absolute.\
    > Confused? See [Frequency Asked Questions](/faq)!

> [!TIP]
>
> For the external links GitHub, GitHub.io, LinkedIn you may want to consider using `target="_blank"` in your anchor elements as these will open these links in new tabs instead of the current one.
>
> See this [resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/a#target) for more details.

##### Title (`<title></title>{:html}`)

Your title should be a combination of your heading 1, heading 2, and a divider of your choice. 

For example if my heading 1 is `Alexander Prechtel's Advanced Pegasus` and my heading 2 is `Home` my title should be `Alexander Prechtel's Advanced Pegasus | Home`.

##### Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

You need to use an embedded stylesheet inside your `<head></head>{:html}` element. To add embedded styles you need to use the `<style></style>{:html}` element.

###### Styling Requirements

Update atleast these elements, using at minimum; `<body>{:html}`, `<h1>{:html}`, and `<h2>{:html}` selectors.

1. Fonts 
> (pick at least two, and differentiate between normal text and headings - generally headings can be more stylized than normal text)

2. Colors
> (hint: [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/generate) - save the URL for reference as it includes your colors.) - at least a background color and font color

3. Margins
> (auto 0, and max-width to something between 600-1000, and width to 80-95%) 

##### Validation

Ensure your personal homepage includes the Accumulus Validator. See this [assignement](accumulus)

#### Content Guidelines

- **Professional tone:** This page should be suitable for anyone to view
- **Personal focus:** This is YOUR page, not a course-specific page
- **No ITIS3135 content:** Course-specific material belongs in the `itis3135/` folder
- **Clean design:** Should look different from your course pages

#### Important Notes

- **Context matters:** "Home page" can refer to different pages depending on context
- **index.html:** Default filename web servers look for
- **Test thoroughly:** Check links work, validate HTML, test in private browsing
- **Ask questions:** When in doubt, ask for clarification (On NinerLink)

#### Quality Standards
- All links must be functional and public
- No HTML validation errors (USE ACCUMULUS)
- Professional appearance and content
- Easy navigation between sections
