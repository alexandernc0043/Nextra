# Create your Design Firm

## Overview

**Note:** For our purposes, when we say *“firm”*, *“design company”*, *“your design firm”*, or *“design firm”* we mean your **web development/design brand**, **not** your animal/whimsical company.  
To distinguish these, we’ll use:

- **Firm** → your design/consulting brand  
- **Mascot/Animal/Fun/Whimsical site** → your creative project site with business idea & products

---

### Setting up Your Design Firm

- Create your design/consulting firm brand in a **subfolder** within your course folder.  
- All your other pages (outside this subfolder) will link to it in their footers:  
  Example: *“Page designed by YourName Enterprises”* (with *YourName* linked to your firm).  
- Add a link to this firm page in the footer of your Whimsical Company site as well.

---

### Naming and Domain

1. Come up with a firm name that includes your own name.  
   - Examples: *Jackson Enterprises*, *JJ Unlimited*.
2. Search a domain registrar for an **available domain**.  
   - Example folder: `vonbriesenenterprises.org/`
3. Inside your course folder, create a folder named after that domain (including `.com`, `.org`, etc.).  
   - Example: `icabaddesignsinc.co/`


---

### Page Requirements

- This firm’s page is **unique** → no shared headers/footers from other pages.  
- Still include semantic structure: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`.  
- Make a **simple `index.html` page**.

#### Styles
- Use an **embedded stylesheet** (`<style>` in the `<head>`).  
- Generate a palette from [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) and save the URL in a comment above your styles.  
- Apply colors carefully (check contrast with WCAG guidelines).

#### Linking
- Update footers on all your other pages:  
  - Link *“Designed by …”* text to this firm folder (relative link).  
  - Example: `href="companyname.cc/"`

---

### Content Guidelines

#### Header
- Must include:
  - A **graphic/logo** (public domain or free-to-use, e.g., CC0/CC1)  
  - An **`h1` element** with your firm’s name, adjacent to the logo
- Resize logo appropriately in an editor; don’t upscale.  
- Include correct `height`, `width`, and `alt` attributes.

#### Main
- Begin with an `h2` like: *“So-and-so’s Services”*.  
- Add:
  1. A descriptive **paragraph** about your firm.  
  2. An **unordered list** (with non-standard bullet style) listing 5–10 fictional “amazing” qualities of your firm.  
  3. A closing **paragraph** outlining what you’d like to do for clients.  
  4. A nicely formatted **contact block** (fake email, phone, address).

#### Footer
- Should **not** say *“Designed by …”*.  
- Instead, include:
  - A **tagline/slogan** unique to your firm  
  - Copyright notice (`© 2025 YourName Enterprises`)

---

### Additional Requirements

- Site should look **completely different** from your class site.  
- Use semantic HTML elements instead of custom classes (e.g., `<nav>` instead of `.menu`).  
- No external CSS files needed since styles are embedded.  
- Keep normal folder organization for assets (`/images`, `/scripts`, etc.), but no `/styles`.  
- Ensure accessibility and proper formatting/punctuation.  
- Validate HTML & CSS.  
- Publish to both **GitHub** and **University Pages**.
