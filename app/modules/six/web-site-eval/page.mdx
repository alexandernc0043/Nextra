# Website Evaluations Assignment

## Step 1: Learn CRAP
Do some searches on the web for **CRAP principles of design**. Memorize the acronym, and do some research on examples so that you can comfortably apply these principles to evaluating a webpage (or even a poster or book cover).  

Here are some resources to get you started:
- [Google Search: CRAP design principles](https://www.google.com/search?q=crap+design+principles&tbm=isch) (images)
- [Principles of Design (CRAP) – YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=principles+of+design+crap)

**CRAP** stands for:
- **C**ontrast  
- **R**epetition  
- **A**lignment  
- **P**roximity

## Step 2: Find Websites
1. Find one website you think is **well done**.  
2. Find another that is **terrible** (the more terrible, the better).  

Take a moment to evaluate each one against the **CRAP principles**.

## Step 3: Build Your Webpage
- Create a new page in your site called:  
  **`website_evaluations.html`**

- Update menus across all pages to link to this new page.  
- Include your **standard design elements** (common header, footer, etc).  

---

## Step 4: Content Requirements
Inside the `<main>` element:

1. Add an **`<h2>`** page title:  
   **Website Evaluations**

2. For **each site**, create a `<section>` element:
   - Inside it, include the site name as a clickable link in an **`<h3>`** heading.  
   - Example:  
     ```html
     <h3><a href="https://example.com">Example Site</a></h3>
     ```

3. Add a **paragraph** with a simple description of the site.  

4. Add an **unordered list** (`<ul>`) with each of the **CRAP principles**.  
   - Under each principle, include **your assessment** of how well (or poorly) the site follows it (1–2 sentences each).  

---

## Step 5: Submit
- Submit the URL to your **course index page**, which should in turn include a menu link to your new **Website Evaluations** page.  

---

### Summary
- Learn CRAP principles.  
- Find one good and one bad site.  
- Build a webpage to evaluate both sites.  
- Add that page to your site and link it in the menu.
