# Accumulus Validator Setup

Every page in this course should include Accumulus, software designed to provide you feedback on your website within your browser. Accumulus is easy to add to your website, to do so, please follow the following video tutorials. Accumulus greatly assists in the ability for the TAs of this course to grade you. It also helps you to write better web code! A former student and current software developer created this to evaluate a number of components of webpages, including structure, accessibility compliance, and standardization. Every page you submit should pass all tests - which will run when you load the page on a public server. In addition you must manually test the WCAG standards by clicking the Accumulus cloud and choosing WCAG.
